        <dl>
            <dt>What is a Yurt?</dt>
            <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has<br>
                canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.</dd>

            <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy<br>
                couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your<br>
                luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water.<br>
                Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>

            <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing<br>
                weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a<br>
                sense of adventure!</dd>
